Thanks to the great feedback I received on this presentation (requests for "more code!") I have created this simple demo module.

It is very bare bones but hopefully it is enough to illustrate some of the concepts I talked about:

simple & "complex" data collection
  jQuery.data
  
Rick Strahl's ServiceProxy.js
  jQuery.ajax
  Communication with WCF & ASMX

My contact information is within the PDF (in the documents folder) if you should like to discuss. Or find me on twitter @irobinson.
